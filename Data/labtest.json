    "Sample Required?": "A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm or a drop of blood from a skin prick; sometimes a random urine sample is used. Some diabetics may use a continuous glucose monitor, which uses a small sensor wire inserted beneath the skin of the abdomen to measure blood glucose at frequent intervals and provides a result.",
    "Test Preparation Needed?": "In general, it is recommended that you fast (nothing to eat or drink except water) for at least 8 hours before having a blood glucose test. For people with diabetes, glucose levels are often checked both while fasting and after meals to provide the best control of diabetes.
